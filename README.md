# Learning Scala ![Scala](https://raw.github.com/peregin/learning-scala/master/doc/scala.png "logo")

## Motivation
Provide an easy way to learn the Scala language, having basic programming skills or coming from another language.
After completing the first sessions focusing on basic language knowledge and characteristics the shift is towards 
the functional aspect of Scala.
The sessions are presenting theoretical knowledge with hands on exercises.  

## Topics

 * strictness and laziness
 * various manifestations of polymorphism
 * type classes
 * for comprehensions
 * type variance
 * monoids
 * functors, applicatives
 * validations
 * monads
 * monad transformers (option, either)
 * reader, writer, state
 * io effects / zio
 * data structures (Nel, Nec, etc)
